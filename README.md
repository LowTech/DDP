Course Project for the Coursera "Developing Data Projects" class: Inspecting Phoenix Data

The Phoenix Data Project is an open source project for generating political event data--conflict (coups, wars, that kinda stuff) and cooperation (alliance activity, declarations of peace, etc.). Fun! This small app just looks at the # of recorded events per day, and the distribution of conflict and cooperation.
